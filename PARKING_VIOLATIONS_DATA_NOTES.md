# Parking Violations Data - Important Notes

## ⚠️ Data Freshness Warning

**The parking violations data is NOT real-time.** Here's what you need to know:

### Current Data Source
- **Dataset**: NYC Open Data - Parking Violations Issued (Fiscal Year 2024)
- **URL**: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2024/pvqr-7yc4
- **Data Period**: Historical data from **2023**
- **Last Updated**: The dataset contains violations from 2023, approximately 1-2 years old

### What This Means
1. **Violation counts are historical** - they represent violations that occurred in 2023
2. **Not current enforcement data** - doesn't reflect recent parking enforcement activity
3. **May not reflect current conditions** - street conditions, enforcement patterns, or regulations may have changed since 2023

### API Response Includes Transparency
The API now includes these fields to be transparent about data limitations:

```json
{
  "violation_info": {
    "violation_count": 1,
    "data_freshness": "Historical data from 2023 (not real-time)",
    "data_source": "NYC Open Data - Parking Violations Dataset",
    "dataset_url": "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2024/pvqr-7yc4"
  }
}
```

### Available Endpoints
1. **`GET /api/v1/parking/violations-by-zone/{zone_number}`**
   - Complete workflow: Zone → Address → Historical Violation Count
   - Example: `106184` → `LITTLE WEST 12 STREET` → `1 violation (2023 data)`

2. **`GET /api/v1/parking/violations-by-street/{street_name}`**
   - Direct street violation lookup (historical data)
   - Example: `LITTLE WEST 12 STREET` → `1 violation (2023 data)`

3. **`GET /api/v1/parking/violation-count/{zone_number}`** ⭐ **NEW**
   - Simplified endpoint: Zone → Violation Count Only
   - Returns just the essential info: zone, street, count, data freshness
   - Example: `106184` → `1 violation (2023 data)`

### Real-Time Alternatives
For current parking information, consider:
1. **NYC DOT Real-Time Parking Data** (if available)
2. **NYC 311 API** for current parking regulations
3. **NYC Open Data** for more recent datasets (check for 2024/2025 data)

### Example Usage
```bash
# Get historical violations for zone 106184
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/parking/violations-by-zone/106184"

# Response includes data freshness warning
{
  "success": true,
  "zone_number": "106184",
  "street_name": "LITTLE WEST 12 STREET",
  "violation_info": {
    "violation_count": 1,
    "data_freshness": "Historical data from 2023 (not real-time)",
    "data_source": "NYC Open Data - Parking Violations Dataset"
  }
}
```

### Recommendations
1. **Use for historical analysis** - good for understanding past enforcement patterns
2. **Combine with current data** - pair with real-time parking meter data for complete picture
3. **Consider data age** - factor in that conditions may have changed since 2023
4. **Check for updates** - periodically check NYC Open Data for newer violation datasets

### Technical Implementation
The system correctly:
- ✅ Queries NYC Open Data APIs
- ✅ Normalizes street names for API compatibility
- ✅ Provides transparent data freshness information
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ⚠️ Uses historical (2023) violation data, not real-time
